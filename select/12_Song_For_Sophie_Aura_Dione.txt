This is a song for a girl called Sophie
Used to write her name on my arm
Time has made us strangers
And I don't know her anymore

But I really hope she's made it
That someone took her home
She was lost, but wasn't missing
She would always walk alone

She was always like a feather in the air
I never knew if she was flying or falling
She was always like a feather in my life
I hope she flies
(I hope she flies)
(I hope she flies)
(I hope she flies)

Because of her, I look for things that last
I have a chain, where's your arm?
A promise can be broken
I won't hunt you anymore
No, no, no

But I really hope she's made it
That someone took her home
She was lost, but wasn't missing
She would always walk alone

She was always like a feather in the air
I never knew if she was flying or falling
She was always like a feather in my life
I hope she flies

She, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
(I hope she flies)
I hope she flies
(I hope she flies)
(I hope she flies)

(I hope she flies) she, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
She, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
She, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
She, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
(I hope she flies)

She was always like a feather in the air
I never knew if she was flying or falling
She was always like a feather in my life
I hope she flies
I hope she flies
I hope she flies
I hope she flies

She, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
